# 🎥 AutoAdaptAI — Real-Time Personalized Video Summarizer

AutoAdaptAI is a cutting-edge deep learning system that intelligently summarizes live or recorded video content using computer vision, natural language processing, and real-time stream processing. Built entirely with PyTorch, torchtune, Kafka, and Kubernetes — it combines multiple domains of AI into a scalable, modular platform.

## 🚀 Key Features
- 🎯 **Action & Object Detection** using PyTorch + torchvision
- 🧠 **Scene Captioning & Understanding** with Vision-Language Models
- 📝 **LLM-Powered Transcription Summarization** with torchtune
- 📦 **Kafka Stream Processing** of video and audio
- ⚙️ **Kubernetes Deployment** with Dockerized microservices
- 🎙️ (Optional) TTS Audio Narration of Highlights
